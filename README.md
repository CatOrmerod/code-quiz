Homework Assignment 04 - Code Quiz Challenge with multiple choice answers

## Motivation

This is a 60 sec quiz that tests your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.     

## Features of the Code Quiz

```
On the click of the start button a few things happen:
    * The Hero Image disappears
    * The start button disappears
    * A question is loaded on to the screen, with 4 possible answers in buttons
    * The timer begins to countdown to 0
Once the user selects their answer the js then compares it to the correct answer and then:
    * If correct a new question is loaded
    * If incorrect 10sec is deducted from the timer
Once the questions have been exhausted, or the timer runs out the game ends.  
    * If the user was successful their highscore will be saved into the local storage
    * If unsuccessful an alert will pop up to tell them the game is over
Highscores are held in a list that appears on selection of the show Highscores button.  Initially I has a table here but was advised that the use of table is fairly outdated
so I removed it and popped the details in a list instead

```
